Project Based on Smart Health and Hygiene

Bmax is a program based on python which is a free and cross platform language. Bmax is created to advice and guide people on ailments by utilising data stored on the database and to provide basic medications as well as other kinds of remedies to prevent the disease. A search button linked to the database as well as Wikipediaâ€™s website provides a clear insight on any disease that exists. The database advices people basic
medications, execises and even home remedies for a speedy recovery. These things will not only prevent people from taking any wrong steps due to panic but also would be able to kill major issues in grass root level. It will also reduce peoples neglegency towards minor issues that can result in major problems in the future. Bmax gives you a daily healthy routine with recommended diet. From healthy carbohydrate rich breakfast to exercises for your body bmax covers them all aswell as detailed and custom exercises dedicated for every part of the body individually. Bmax also keeps an eagle eye on the ongoing testings, cases, recoveries and
unfortunate deaths around the globe due to the covid pandemic.
